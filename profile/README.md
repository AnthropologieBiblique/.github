## Welcome to Anthropologie Biblique ! ðŸ‘‹
Anthropologie Biblique is a group of French catholics whose aim is to provide digital tools or ressources to help exegesis and theological work. Recent years have seen an impressive expansion of "Personnal Knowledge Management" softwares, and we think these are particularly well suited for Bible or theological study.

### Markdown, backlinks : modern tools for ancient texts and future-proof work
We think that modern features such as interconnected texts, notes or blocks can provide searchers with new insights for their studies.
We also think that all ressources should be as close as possible to plaintext, which is the only universal digital format.
Markdown format seems to be a good balance between universality and power, especially when it's used within a software such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

### Opinionated syntax - but hopefully convincing
Any syntax which wouldn't be pure plaintext is opinionated. We have built a common syntax for all the ressources that you'll find here.
That syntax is mainly based on Obsidian's Markdown flavour with [[wikilinks]], Yaml frontmatters and #tag/trees. We have always tried to keep it as universal as we could without compromising the powerful features of Obsidian.

### Free content & Open source power
We sincerely hope that the different repositories here will attract contributors interested by the ressources willing to contribute and make this biblical and theological database grow in popularity and quality over time by adding new ressources, correcting mistakes etc... 

### What you'll find here
* "Obsidian-ready" Markdown Bible or theological works, free of rights
* Open source scripts that were used to extract these ressources
* Bible study oriented Obsidian plugins or templater scripts
* Documentation or tutorials on how to use the above ressources for your exegesis or theological research
